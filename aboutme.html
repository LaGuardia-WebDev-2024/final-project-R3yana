         I've played piano since I was 5. My favorite pieces I've played were L'Orange and... Playing piano for that long gave me a love/hate relationship with the instrument. There were times I wanted to quit out of fustration but no one ever tells you how much an instument can mean to you and give you a way to fully feel music; not just listening to it but have technique to make someone feel what you're feeling by playing the peice with passion and not just playing the piece. I've never felt closer with this instument until now.

          I would say ive been singing since I was little but I'd be lying. I mean yes I've been singing, but I've only been training my voice in highschool. I've never had outside training, so im proud of the growth I've accumalated now. Being able to sing classical music and musical theater without wondering if I sound horendous has been a gift that I'm glad I found. The fact that people are telling me to sing instead of telling me to shut up is surprising and singing has become something so special to me that I would want to make a carrer out of it.
